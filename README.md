# Dayous - a card game forked from the Russian game дурак / durak

## Etymology
The word *dayous* comes from the Farsi word ([definition here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dayous)).

## Overall objective
This game can be played by 2-8 people and can involve one or multiple poker card decks. The game can take from 5 minutes (2 person, 1 deck) to up to 1h (5 persons, 2 decks). During the game, each player takes term to attack other players and defend themselves. The overall goal is to **not be the last person to have cards on their hand**. If you are the last person to still have cards, you are the *dayous*. 

## Elements
- The lowest card in the game is 2, whereas the highest card in the game is A.
- One suit will be drawn as the **trump suit** in the first half of the game, and another trump suit will be drawn for the second half of the game. Cards in the trump suit are always higher than cards not in the trump suit.
- The order looks like this: A of trump suit > K of trump suit > ... > 2 of trump suit > As of non-trump suits > ... > 2 of non-trump suits.

## Initial setup
At the start of the game:

- Each player gets 7 cards if using 1 deck or 10 cards if using 2 or more decks.
- The remaining cards are placed face down in the center and split equally into 2 decks.

One deck is chosen at random, and its top card is flipped. The suit of this card becomes the **trump suit** for the first half of the game.
Place the flipped card's deck under the other deck, keeping the flipped card face up and sticking out from the deck.

The person who has the lowest card under the trump suit in their hand starts the game. If multiple persons have the lowest card, among them, the person with the second lowest card starts the game. The person who starts the game also chooses the direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) of the game.
