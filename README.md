# Dayous - a card game forked from the Russian game дурак / durak

## Etymology
The word *dayous* comes from the Farsi word ([definition here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dayous), [another definition here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayouth)).

## Objective
Dayous is a 2–8 player game using one or more decks of poker cards. A game lasts from 5 minutes (2 players, 1 deck) to an hour (5 players, 2 decks). The goal is simple: don’t be the last person holding cards. If you are, you’re the dayous.

## Key Rules
- A (highest) -> 2 (lowest)
- One suit is chosen as the trump suit for the first half of the game. A new trump suit is selected for the second half. Cards in the trump suit are always higher than cards not in the trump suit.
    - For example, if diamond is the trump suit, then the order is A:diamonds: > K:diamonds: > ... > 2:diamonds: > ... > A:spades::clubs::hearts: > ... > 2:spades::clubs::hearts:

## Initial setup

### Dealing cards
- Each player gets 7 cards if using 1 deck or 10 cards if using 2 or more decks.

### Drawing the first trump suit
- Place the remaining cards face down and split evenly into 2 decks.
- Flip the top card of one deck to determine the trump suit.
- Place this deck under the other deck, with the flipped card sticking out face up.

### Deciding the first player
- The player with the lowest card in the trump suit starts. If there’s a tie, the next lowest card decides.
- The starting player also sets the play direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).

## Gameplay

### Attacking
- The attacker plays 1 or more cards of the same rank (number on the card) against the next player.

### Defending (colloquially: responding to reviewers' questions)
The defender has 3 options:
- **Pass**: Put down one (or more) card of the same rank as the attacking card(s) to pass them to the next player. 
    - Note: if the number of cards to be passed is more than the number of cards the next player has, then the cards cannot be passed. 
- **Defend**: Play a higher card of the same suit or a trump card (higher trump cards are needed to defend against trump card attacks). Once defending starts, passing is no longer allowed.
- **Use a joker**: Pass the attack back to the original attacker and reverse the play direction. The joker then goes to the discard pile. 
    - Note: if there is more than 1 rank of cards on the table, jokers cannot be used. 

### Additional attacks (colloquially: asking questions)
- Other players can join the attack by playing cards matching ranks already on the table. The total attacks cannot exceed the defender’s hand size.
    -  Example: if the person is attacked with a 5 of diamond and they respond with a 9 of diamond, then other players can put down 5 and 9 of any suit.

### Responding to attacks
- If the defender cannot handle all attacks, they take all table cards into their hand and lose their next turn as the attacker.
- If the defender successfully defends, all table cards go to the discard pile, and the defender becomes the next attacker.

### Refill hands
At the end of the round, each person needs to have at least 7 cards (10 cards for 2+ decks). If they don't have enough cards, they have to draw from the deck in order to have 7 cards (10 cards for 2+ decks).

## Change of the trump suit
- When the flipped trump card reaches the top of the deck, a new trump suit is chosen randomly.
- After everyone finishes refilling their hands, flip the top card to determine the trump suit for the second half.

## Endgame
- Once the deck is empty, players can no longer draw cards, and the **endgame** starts
- The game ends when only one player still has cards, making them the **dayous**.


## Common terminology
- **No further questions**: use this term to signal the defender that you don't have additional attacks for them (source: lawyers telling the judge they don't have further questionns for the witness).
- **Moving the field forward / being prosocial**: trying hard to respond to all the incoming attacks and move the cards to the discard pile (otherwise the same cards will be used to attack over and over again).
- **Eric Martínez**: Aces of non-trump suits.
- **Dr. Eric Harper Martínez Esq. J.D. Harvard, Ph.D. MIT**: Ace(s) of the trump suit.
- **Contribution**: the number of cards going to the discard pile after a successful defense.
