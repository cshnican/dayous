# Dayous - a card game forked from the Russian game дурак / durak

## Etymology
The word *dayous* comes from the Farsi word ([definition here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dayous), [another definition here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayouth)).

## Overall objective
This game can be played by 2-8 people and can involve one or multiple poker card decks. The game can take from 5 minutes (2 person, 1 deck) to up to 1h (5 persons, 2 decks). During the game, each player takes term to attack other players and defend themselves. The overall goal is to **not be the last person to have cards on their hand**. If you are the last person to still have cards, you are the *dayous*. 

## Elements
- The lowest card in the game is 2, whereas the highest card in the game is A.
- One suit will be drawn as the **trump suit** in the first half of the game, and another trump suit will be drawn for the second half of the game. Cards in the trump suit are always higher than cards not in the trump suit.
- The order looks like this: A of trump suit > K of trump suit > ... > 2 of trump suit > A of non-trump suits > ... > 2 of non-trump suits.

## Initial setup
At the start of the game:

- Each player gets 7 cards if using 1 deck or 10 cards if using 2 or more decks.
- The remaining cards are placed face down in the center and split equally into 2 decks.

One deck is chosen at random, and its top card is flipped. The suit of this card becomes the **trump suit** for the first half of the game.
Place the flipped card's deck under the other deck, keeping the flipped card face up and sticking out from the deck.

The person who has the lowest card under the trump suit in their hand starts the game. If multiple persons have the lowest card, among them, the person with the second lowest card starts the game. The person who starts the game also chooses the direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) of the game.

## Gameplay
During one round, a player attacks the player next to them (as determined by the direction of the game) with at least 1 card. If the player wants to attack with multiple cards, they should be of the same number.

The person being attacked can do one of the following things:
- They put down a card of the same number and pass the attack to the person next to them
- For each card they are attacked with, they respond with either a card of the same suit but of higher number, or a card under the trump suit (if they are attacked with a card of the trump suit, they can only respond with a higher numbered card of the trump suit). If they start responding, they cannot pass the attack to the next person.

At the same time, other players besides the attacker and the responder can join the attack by putting down any card of the same number with those on the table (e.g. if the person is attacked with a 5 of diamond and they respond with a 9 of diamond, then other players can put down 5 and 9 of any suit), and the person being attacked needs to respond to all of them. 

If the player cannot respond to all the attacks, they have to take all the cards on the table to their hand, and they will lose their turn to be the attacker next round.

If thee player successfully responds to all the attacks, then all cards on the table go to the discarded pile and are removed from the game. They will be the attacker next round.

At the end of the round, each person needs to have at least 7 cards (10 cards for 2 decks). If they don't have enough cards, they have to draw from the deck in order to have 7 (1 deck) or 10 (2 decks) cards.
