    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>The word <em>dayous</em> comes from the Farsi word (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dayous">definition here</a>).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Dayous is a 2–8 player game using one or more decks of poker cards. A game lasts from 5 minutes (2 players, 1 deck) to an hour (5 players, 2 decks). The goal is simple: don’t be the last person holding cards. If you are, you’re the <em>dayous</em>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Key Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A (highest) -> 2 (lowest)</li>
                <li>One suit is chosen as the trump suit for the first half of the game. A new trump suit is selected for the second half. Cards in the trump suit are always higher than cards not in the trump suit.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, if diamond is the trump suit, then the order is A <span class="code">♦</span> > K <span class="code">♦</span> > ... > 2 <span class="code">♦</span> > ... > A <span class="code">♠ ♣ ♥</span> > ... > 2 <span class="code">♠ ♣ ♥</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <h3>Dealing Cards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player gets 7 cards if using 1 deck or 10 cards if using 2 or more decks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Drawing the First Trump Suit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the remaining cards face down and split evenly into 2 decks.</li>
                <li>Flip the top card of one deck to determine the trump suit.</li>
                <li>Place this deck under the other deck, with the flipped card sticking out face up.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Deciding the First Player</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The player with the lowest card in the trump suit starts. If there’s a tie, the next lowest card decides.</li>
                <li>The starting player also sets the play direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>Attacking</h3>
            <p>The attacker plays 1 or more cards of the same rank (number on the card) against the next player.</p>
            <h3>Defending</h3>
            <p>The defender has 3 options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pass</strong>: Put down one (or more) card of the same rank as the attacking card(s) to pass them to the next player.</li>
                <li><strong>Defend</strong>: Play a higher card of the same suit or a trump card. Once defending starts, passing is no longer allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a joker</strong>: Pass the attack back to the original attacker and reverse the play direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Additional Attacks</h3>
            <p>Other players can join the attack by playing cards matching ranks already on the table.</p>
            <h3>Responding to Attacks</h3>
            <p>If the defender cannot handle all attacks, they take all table cards into their hand and lose their next turn as the attacker. If the defender successfully defends, all table cards go to the discard pile, and the defender becomes the next attacker.</p>
            <h3>Refill Hands</h3>
            <p>At the end of the round, each person needs to have at least 7 cards (10 cards for 2+ decks).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Change of the Trump Suit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When the flipped trump card reaches the top of the deck, a new trump suit is chosen randomly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Endgame</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the deck is empty, players can no longer draw cards, and the <strong>endgame</strong> starts.</li>
                <li>The game ends when only one player still has cards, making them the <em>dayous</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
